    "Python is something called an “object-oriented programming language.” What this means is there’s a construct in Python called a class that lets you structure your software in a particular way. Using classes, you can add consistency to your programs so that they can be used in a cleaner way. Modules are like dictionaries.In this case we get the age using the def command to specify to Python what it has to do once its variable is entered.\n"

You use has-a when you talk about objects and classes that are related only because they reference each other.Now, go through this piece of code and replace each ## ?? comment with a replacement com- ment that says whether the next line represents an is-a or a has-a relationship and what that relationship is.

    "The other idea in this process is that it’s not just something you do at one single level but some- thing that you can do at every level when you run into a particular problem. Let’s say I don’t know how to write the Engine.play method yet. I can stop and do this whole process on just that one function to ﬁgure out how to write it.This process I ﬁnd is better once you’re more solid at programming and are naturally thinking in code about problems. This process is very good when you know small pieces of the overall puzzle but maybe don’t have enough information yet about the overall concept. Breaking it down in little pieces and exploring with code then helps you slowly grind away at the problem until you’ve solved it. However, remember that your solution will probably be meandering and weird, so that’s why my version of this process involves going back and ﬁnding research then cleaning things up based on what you’ve learned."
