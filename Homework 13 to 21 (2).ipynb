    "In this exercise, we will cover one more input method that you can use to pass variables to a script (the script is another name for your .py files). Do you know how to write python ex13.py to execute the ex13.py file? Well, the ex13.py part of the command is called \"argument.\" What we will do now is write a script that also accepts arguments. On line 1 we have what’s called an “import.”  The argv is the “argument variable,” a very standard name in programming that you will ﬁnd used in many other languages. This variable holds the arguments you pass to your Python script when you run it. In the exercises you will get to play with this more and see what happens."
